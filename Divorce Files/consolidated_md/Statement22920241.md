This table presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months.
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed.
These estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed income are calculated using the security's coupon
rate. The estimates for all other securities are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next
12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no assurance can
be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.
Bond & CD Income includes interest payments for fixed and variable rate bonds, international bonds that pay in USD, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
Bond & CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for fixed and variable rate bonds, international bonds that pay in USD, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
Stock Income includes estimated dividend payments for common stocks, preferred stocks, ADRs, closed-end mutual funds, and MLPs.
ETP Income includes estimated dividend payments for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs).
Mutual Fund Income includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds.
Other Income includes, but is not limited to estimated dividend payments for Unit Investment Trusts (UITs), REITs, and LPs.
This table does not include cash flow from foreign denominated fixed income.

Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY) - EAI for fixed income is calculated using the coupon rate. For all other securities, EAI is calculated using an
indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for
that security. EY reflects only the income generated by an investment and not changes in its price which may fluctuate. Interest and dividend rates are subject to change at
any time and may be affected by current and future economic, political and business conditions. EAI and EY are provided for informational purposes only and should not
be used or relied on for making investment, trading or tax decisions. EAI and EY are based on data obtained from information providers believed to be reliable, but no
assurance can be made as to accuracy, timeliness or completeness.
