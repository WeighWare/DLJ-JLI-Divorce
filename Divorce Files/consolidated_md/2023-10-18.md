About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called
"trailing interest". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that
happens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest
on purchases by paying your balance in full and on time each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your
Cardmember Agreement for details.

communication. SeeDetermining the Prime Rate in Part 2 of your Cardmember Agreement for more details on how
we determine the Prime Rate. If the Prime Rate changes after the date of this communication, the APRs and DPRs
will change accordingly.

Notice of Important Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement
We are making changes to your American Express Cardmember Agreement(Agreement) for the Account
referenced by this notice. We encourage you to read this notice, share it with Additional Card Members on your
Account, and file it for future reference. The detailed changes to your Agreement can be found after the below
summary chart.
Summary of Changes, Effective January 1, 2024
MQD Boost We are adding a new benefit, MQD Boost, to your Card. You will be able to earn one
Medallion Qualification Dollar (MQD) for each $10 of eligible purchases charged to
the Card Account.
Status Boostº Award This benefit will no longer be available and you will no longer be able to receive a
Status Boostº award.
ID 13439
Detail of Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement
This notice amends your Agreement as described below. Any terms and conditions in the Agreement conflicting
with these changes are completely replaced. Terms and conditions not changed by this notice continue to apply.
If you have any questions, please call the number on the back of your Card.
Effective January 1, 2024, the section titled "How you can receive a Status Boostº award of Medallion
Qualification Miles each calendar year" is deleted. We are adding the following new section:
"MQD Boost
You will earn one (1) Medallion Qualification Dollar (MQD) for each $10 of eligible purchases charged to your
Card Account during a Qualification Year. MQDs earned during a Qualification Year are used to determine
qualification for Medallion Status for the subsequent Medallion Year for the SkyMiles account associated with
your Card Account. MQDs have no cash value and are not redeemable for Award Travel or other SkyMiles
redemptions. MQDs are not transferrable or assignable to any other person and cannot be gifted to another
SkyMiles member.
All Medallion Status Qualification and Medallion Benefits rules and policies apply and may be viewed at
delta.com/medallion. MQDs will not extend or roll over from year to year, and MQD balance will be reset to zero
on or about January 1 each calendar year. Medallion Status is calculated annually based on activity during a
Qualification Year. A Qualification Year is from January 1 to December 31 of a given year. The close of the
Qualification Year is December 31, without regard to the time of the year that the Card Account is opened. This
means that for the first year of Card Membership, the Card Member's eligible purchase period for the MQD
Benefit may be shorter than twelve months.
Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do
NOT include fees, interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers' checks, person-to-person
transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, or purchases of other cash
equivalents. American Express relies on the transaction date submitted to us by the merchant, which may differ
from the date you make a purchase, to determine whether the purchase counts toward the MQD threshold in that
Qualification Year. This means that in some cases your purchases may not count toward the MQD threshold in
the year in which you made the purchases.

IMPORTANT NOTICES continued
For example, if you make a purchase on December 31 and the merchant lists the transaction date as January 1
when they submit the transaction data to us, your purchase will be counted in the Qualification Year which began
on that January 1. MQDs will be deducted from the MQD Balance (and may result in a negative MQD Balance)
for any returns or other credits, and Delta reserves the right to adjust, remove, or suspend Medallion Status if you
return, reverse or charge back eligible purchases in a way that reduces your MQD balance below the threshold of
any Medallion Tier for the preceding Qualification Year. If Delta and/or American Express determine that you have
engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this MQD Benefit in any way or that you intend to do so,
Delta may not credit, Delta may freeze, or Delta may take away MQDs from your account or terminate your
participation in the SkyMiles Program.
MQDs may take 8 to 12 weeks after the eligible transaction posts to the Card Account to be posted to the Basic
Card Member's Delta SkyMiles account. Basic Card Members can confirm their MQD progress for a Qualification
Year by logging into their SkyMiles account on delta.com or in the Fly Delta app."
