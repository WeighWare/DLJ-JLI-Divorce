This table presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months.
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed.
These estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed income are calculated using the security's coupon
rate. The estimates for all other securities are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next
12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no assurance can
be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.
Bond & CD Income includes interest payments for fixed and variable rate bonds, international bonds that pay in USD, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
Bond & CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for fixed and variable rate bonds, international bonds that pay in USD, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
Stock Income includes estimated dividend payments for common stocks, preferred stocks, ADRs, closed-end mutual funds, and MLPs.
ETP Income includes estimated dividend payments for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs).
Mutual Fund Income includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds.
Other Income includes, but is not limited to estimated dividend payments for Unit Investment Trusts (UITs), REITs, and LPs.
This table does not include cash flow from foreign denominated fixed income.

National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (FBS) provides custody and clearing services on behalf of FBS. In that
capacity, NFS is required to provide you with written notice on the manner in which you may gain website access to information regarding NFS' Impartial Callable
Securities Lottery Process (the "Lottery Process").
We are also providing you with the following description of the Lottery Process: When street name or bearer securities held for you are subject to a partial call or
partial redemption by the issuer, National Financial Services LLC (NFS) may or may not receive an allocation of called/redeemed securities by the issuer, transfer
agent, and/or depository. If NFS is allocated a portion of the called/redeemed securities, NFS utilizes an impartial lottery allocation system, in accordance with
applicable rules, that randomly selects the securities within customer accounts that will be called/redeemed. NFS' allocations are not made on a pro rata basis and it is
possible for you to receive a full or partial allocation, or no allocation.
A more detailed description of the Lottery Process may be accessed by visiting Fidelity.com/callable-securities. You may also request a hard copy of the Lottery
Process by writing to National Financial Services LLC, P.O Box 770001, Cincinnati, OH 45277. 695949.2.0
If your brokerage account is established with asset based pricing, please review the terms and conditions governing this program:
https://clearingcustody.fidelity.com/app/literature/item/868856.html. If you have any questions, please contact your advisor. 911663.1.0
In an effort to streamline and enhance the statement experience, we have removed the Core Account Cash Flow table from statements beginning October 2023.
1102165.3.0
Wex Bank will be removed from the Bank Deposit Sweep Program bank list by May 2024. You are not required to take action. If you have questions, please contact
your financial professional. 1008950.6.3
Effective December 2023, the Retirement Account and Brokerage Account Client Agreements have been updated. You can obtain the most current versions of the
Client Agreements at https://mybrokerageinfo.com/customeragreement. Please contact your Authorized agent/Advisor should you have any questions. 746693.7.0
Fidelity is changing the Core Transaction Account options available for your Fidelity non-retirement brokerage account. If you currently use an option other than
FCASH as the Core Transaction Account option for your non-retirement brokerage account, you may continue to use that Core Transaction Account option. However,
to the extent applicable, effective March 15, 2024, if you wish to change your current Core Transaction Account option, the only available option for your
non-retirement brokerage account will be FCASH. FCASH is an interest-bearing free credit balance, it has no separate fees, and it is not a money market mutual fund
or a bank deposit account. It is not covered by FDIC insurance, but is protected in accordance with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) . Fidelity may
but is not required to pay interest on FCASH balances. Any interest paid on your FCASH balance is taxable. Fidelity receives an economic benefit from FCASH.
Please see the Client Agreement which governs your Fidelity brokerage account for more details. (https://mybrokerageinfo.com/customeragreement) To the extent that
the customer free credits exceed available SIPC protection and the "excess of SIPC" coverage, the customer is at risk of the potential of loss of funds, if the broker
dealer becomes insolvent and has insufficient cash on hands to meet customers' obligations. For more information, including the SIPC brochure, please see
www.sipc.org or call 1-202-371-8300. 1117467.1.0

Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY) - EAI for fixed income is calculated using the coupon rate. For all other securities, EAI is calculated using an
indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for
that security. EY reflects only the income generated by an investment and not changes in its price which may fluctuate. Interest and dividend rates are subject to change at
any time and may be affected by current and future economic, political and business conditions. EAI and EY are provided for informational purposes only and should not
