About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called
"trailing interest". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that
happens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest
on purchases by paying your balance in full and on time each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your
Cardmember Agreement for details.
