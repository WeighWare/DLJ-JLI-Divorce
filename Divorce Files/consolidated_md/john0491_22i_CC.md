## Content
The IRS uses refunds to cover overdue taxes and notifies you when this occurs. The Fiscal Service offsets refunds
through the Treasury Offset Program to cover past due child support, federal agency non-tax debts such as student loans
and state income tax obligations. Fiscal Service sends you an offset notice if it applies your refund or part of your refund
to non-tax debts. If you have questions about the offset, contact the agency identified in the notice. You may also call the
Treasury Offset Program Call Center at 1-800-304-3107, if you have additional questions.
If You Owe Tax
If your return has a balance due, you must pay the amount you owe by the prescribed due date. If you paid by electronic
funds withdrawal (direct debit) or by credit card, no voucher is needed. The credit card service providers will charge a
convenience fee based on the amount of taxes you are paying. The fees and the type of credit or debit cards accepted
may vary between providers. You will be told the amount of the fee during the transaction and you will be given the option
to either continue or end the transaction. For information on paying your taxes electronically, including by credit or debit
card, go to www.irs.gov/e-pay.
If you are not paying electronically you may use Form 1040-V, Payment Voucher, which you can obtain from your
Electronic Return Originator. If the IRS does not receive your payment by the prescribed due date, you will receive a
notice that requests full payment of the tax due, plus penalties and interest. If you can not pay the amount in full, complete
Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, which you may file electronically. To apply for an installment agreement
online, go to www.irs.gov. You may also order Form 9465 by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). If approved, the
Y
IRS charges a user fee to set up an installment agreement.
If You Need to Inquire About Your Electronic Funds Withdrawal Payment
You may call 1-888-353-4537 to inquire about the status oPf your electronic funds withdrawal payment. If there is a change
to the bank account information included on your return, you should call this number to cancel a scheduled payment. You
should have available the social security number of the first person listed on the tax return, the payment amount, and the
bank account number. Cancellation requests must be received no later than 11:59 p.m. E.T. two business days prior to
the scheduled payment date.
O
Tax Refund Related Financial Products
Financial institutions offer a variety of financial products to taxpayers based on their refunds. Contracts for financial
products are between you and the financial institution. The IRS is not associated with the contract. If you have questions
C
about tax refund related products, contact your Electronic Return Originator or the lender.
