Daniel and Locke,
Sorry I didn’t get this email to you before the weekend. Here are the items needed to get the ball rolling on the construction loan:
Last two month paystubs for Locke
Cost breakdown
Plans
Daniel, I think it might be a good idea to pull together your financials just to be safe. With rates up and the dollar amount you guys are thinking
on the lot loan, we might be hitting pretty close without your income. I’d rather request them now and not need them instead of requesting them
in the last hours. Here are the items we would need for you:
2020-2021 personal returns
Include w2s and 1099s, if applicable.
Last two months paystubs, if applicable.
Personal Financial Statement, you can complete the one attached or include your own if you have one
2020-2021 business returns for any business you own 25%.
2020-2021 K1’s for any business you own less than 25%.
DL
The files can be uploaded to the sharepoint file below:
Johnson, Daniel & Isaacson, Locke
Let me know if you guys have any questions with the request. We are excited to help you guys move forward on your new dream home!
Thanks,
