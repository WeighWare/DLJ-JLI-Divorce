Hello DANIEL,
Thank you for submitting a business credit application with America First Credit Union. You have been assigned reference #8894894. Kindly use this reference# in all communication so we may easily
identify your application.
We are preparing your application for an underwriter. Next, you will receive an email from a business lending representative to request documentation required to begin the underwriting process. Due to high
loan volume, it may take 3-4 business days before email contact is initiated.
We typically request 2 years complete business and personal tax returns along with current year-to-date financial statements (profit & loss statement and balance sheet). You may upload the documents
directly to your application by accessing the following link: https://www.americafirst.com/services/other-services/new-account-loan-hub.html . This is a secure way to provide sensitive information and allows
access to monitor the status of your application. You may also take your documents to a local America First Credit Union branch office.
If you have questions or concerns, please call us at 801-827-7049 to speak with a business lending representative. Thank you for your time and assistance.
Best Regards,
Business Lending
