About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called
"trailing interest". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that
happens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest
on purchases by paying your balance in full and on time each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your
Cardmember Agreement for details.

IMPORTANT NOTICES
Notice of Important Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement
We are making changes to your American Express Cardmember Agreement(Agreement) for the account
referenced with this notice. We encourage you to read this notice, share it with Additional Card Members on your
Account, and file it for future reference. The detailed changes to your Agreement can be found after the below
summary chart.
We are adding Expanded Buying Power as an embedded feature on your Card and removing the Cash Advance
feature.These changes will be effective on the day after your Closing Date in May, as stated on your billing
statement.
However, if your Total Balance is above your Credit Limit or you have an outstanding Cash Advance Balance on
the day before your Closing Date in May, the Expanded Buying Power feature will not be added to your account
and the Cash Advance feature will not be removed from your account at this time. To be eligible for these changes,
your Total Balance must not be more than your Credit Limit and your Cash Advance Balance must be zero on the
day before your Closing Date in May. If you are enrolled in a payment program, please be advised that these
changes will not apply to your account at this time, and you will continue to receive relief under the payment
program as long as you comply with the terms and conditions of the program. If our systems reflect that you have
successfully exited the payment program by the day before your Closing Date in May, you may be eligible for this
feature. To be eligible for these changes, your account must be active the day before your Closing Date in May. If
you change your Closing Date and the result is that you no longer have a May Closing Date, these changes will still
become effective on your account as if you had not changed your Closing Date.
Once the Expanded Buying Power feature is effective on your Card, you will no longer be able to downgrade to the
Delta SkyMiles® Gold Business American Express Card. If you decide you want the Delta SkyMiles® Gold Business
American Express Card instead of your existing Card after the changes are effective, you will need to cancel your
existing Card and apply for the Delta SkyMiles® Gold Business American Express Card.
Important Changes to Your Account Terms
The following is a summary of the changes that are being made to your account terms. For more detailed
information, please see the Detail of Changes on the following pages.
We are adding a feature called Expanded Buying Power to your Card. Expanded Buying Power gives you the
option to spend above your Credit Limit. The portion of your account balance that is above your Credit Limit is due
in full each month as part of your Minimum Payment Due. You will not incur interest charges on the portion of
your account balance that is above your Credit Limit so long as you pay the entire Minimum Payment Due by the
Closing Date of the billing period in which it is due. If you do not, then the penalty rate will apply to your entire
balance, including any amount above the Credit Limit.
In addition, we are removing the Cash Advance feature on your Card. You will no longer be able to obtain cash
advances at participating ATMs.

IMPORTANT NOTICES continued
We are removing this section in its entirety and replacing it with a new section entitled
"Credit Limit and Amount Above the Credit Limit." This new section will read:
We assign aCredit Limit to the Account. It is shown on page 1 of Part 1 and on each
billing statement. We may increase or reduce the Credit Limit. We may do so even if you
pay on time and the Account is not in default. We may approve charges or assess
interest charges or fees that cause the account balance to go over the Credit Limit. If we
do this, we will not charge an overlimit fee. The part of the New Balance that is above the
Credit Limit appears on your statement as theAmount Above the Credit Limit.
We decide whether to approve a charge that will cause the account balance to go over
the Credit Limit, or that will add to the Amount Above the Credit Limit, based on how you
spend and pay on this Account and other accounts you have with us and our affiliates.
We also consider your credit history and your personal resources that we know about.
If we permit you to make a balance transfer, the amount remaining under the Credit Limit
will be reduced by the amount of the balance transfer and new charges may cause the
account balance to go over the Credit Limit and add to the Amount Above the Credit
Limit.
Credit Limit and For balances under the Credit Limit, you have the option of paying the balance in full
Cash Advance Limit each month, or paying at least the Minimum Payment Due and paying the remaining
balance over time while accruing interest charges. The Amount Above the Credit Limit
will be due in full as part of the monthly Minimum Payment Due (seeHow we calculate
your Minimum Payment Due below).
Interest on the Amount Above the Credit Limit
For any particular billing period, we will not charge interest on the Amount Above the
Credit Limit if you pay at least your Minimum Payment Due from the previous billing
period by the Closing Date of the billing period in which the payment is due (seeWhen
we charge interest below).
If you do not pay your Minimum Payment Due by the Closing Date of the billing period in
which it is due, we will apply the Penalty APR to the entire balance, including the Amount
Above the Credit Limit, if any, and any balance transfers, (seeHow we calculate interest
below). We also may apply the Penalty APR for other reasons (seePenalty APR and
when it applies on page 2 of Part 1). After you pay the Minimum Payment Due shown on
your statement by the Closing Date of the billing period in which it is due, we will no
longer charge interest on the Amount Above the Credit Limit. However, the Penalty APR
will continue to apply to other balances (including any balance transfer) in accordance
withPenalty APR and when it applies on page 2 of Part 1.
We are removing this section in its entirety and replacing it with the modified language: If
the balances on your most recent billing statement are subject to different interest rates,
we apply payments first to the balances with the highest interest rate and then to
balances with lower interest rates. After the balance on your statement has been paid in
full, we apply any additional payments to amounts that have not yet appeared on a
statement, starting with those amounts subject to the highest interest rate and then to
How we apply amounts at lower interest rates. In most cases, we apply a credit to the same balance as
payment and credits the related charge. For example, we apply a credit for a purchase to the purchase
balance. We may apply payments and credits within balances, and among balances with
the same interest rate, in any order we choose.
Effect of Paying the Minimum Payment Due
The effect of paying the Minimum Payment Due is that the Amount Above the Credit
Limit is paid, but only part of the interest bearing balance is reduced.

We are removing this section in its entirety and replacing it with the following new
sections entitled "How we calculate your Minimum Payment Due", "Minimum Payment
Due with No Amount Above the Credit Limit", "Minimum Payment Due with an Amount
Above the Credit Limit" and "Additional Calculations."
How we calculate your Minimum Payment Due
Your Minimum Payment Due is made up of:
any fees,
· any interest,
· any past due amount,
· any Amount Above the Credit Limit,
· and the higher of $35 or a percentage of the New Balance (for information on
· how this amount is calculated, seeMinimum Payment Due with No Amount
Above the Credit Limit andMinimum Payment Due with an Amount Above the
Credit Limit below).
As further explained below, to calculate the Minimum Payment Due for each billing
statement, we use:
the New Balance,
· any Amount Above the Credit Limit,
· the Previous Balance,
· any Interest Charged,
· any Penalty Fees, and
· any Past Due Amount.
·
These amounts can be found on your statement. Your Minimum Payment Due may also
About your Minimum
include any additional amount specified in a promotional offer. Your Minimum Payment
Payment Due
Due will not exceed your New Balance. You may pay more than the Minimum Payment
Due, up to your New Balance, at any time.
Minimum Payment Due with No Amount Above the Credit Limit
Your Minimum Payment Due consists of a portion of your Account balance plus interest
charges and Penalty Fees.
To calculate your Minimum Payment Due for each statement, we first determine the
higher of(1) or(2) below:
(1) $35, or
(2) The amount calculated using the following steps:
1. Calculate Modified New Balance by subtracting the interest and Penalty Fees
charged on the statement from the New Balance on the statement.
2. Calculate the Applicable Rate by:
I. Adding the following together:
1% of the portion of the Modified New Balance less than or equal to
· $25,000and
5% of the portion of the Modified New Balance greater than $25,000
· and less than or equal to $75,000and
10% of the portion of the Modified New Balance greater than $75,000
II.Th·en divide the sum from step I by the Modified New Balance and round
to 4 decimals (ex. 0.1234).
3. Calculate the Portion of the Modified New Balance included in the Minimum
Payment Due by multiplying the Modified New Balance calculated in step 1
by the Applicable Rate calculated in step 2.
4. Add the Interest Charged on the statement to the result from step 3.

Finally, we take the higher of(1) and(2) above and add Penalty Fees. Then we round to
the nearest dollar and add any Past Due Amount.
EXAMPLE:
Assume that your New Balance is $30,000, Interest Charged is $299.59, and you
have no Penalty Fees or Past Due Amount.
(1) $35, or
(2) Calculate the following:
1. Modified New Balance: $30,000 - $299.59 Interest Charged - $0 Penalty Fees =
$29,700.41
2. Applicable Rate: [(1% x $25,000) + (5% x $4,700.41)] / $29,700.41 = 0.0163
3. Portion of the Modified New Balance included in the Minimum Payment Due: $29,700.41
x 0.0163 = $484.12
4. $484.12 + $299.59 Interest Charged = $783.71
The higher of (1) or (2) is $783.71.
$783.71 + $0 Penalty Fees + $0 Past Due Amount = $784.
Minimum Payment Due with an Amount Above the Credit Limit
To calculate your Minimum Payment Due for each statement, we first determine the
higher of(1) or(2) below:
(1) $35, or
(2) The amount calculated using the following steps:
1. Calculate Modified New Balance by subtracting the Amount Above the Credit
Limit, interest and Penalty Fees charged on the statement from the New
Balance on the statement. For this calculation:
I. We will only subtract the amount of Interest Charged that is not included in
the Amount Above the Credit Limit from the New Balance. See How to
determine whether Interest Charged is included in the Amount Above the
Credit Limit below.
II.We will only subtract the amount of Penalty Fees that is not included in the
Amount Above the Credit Limit from the New Balance. See How to
determine whether Penalty Fees are included in the Amount Above the
Credit Limit below.
2. Calculate the Applicable Rate by:
I. Adding the following together:
1% of the portion of the Modified New Balance less than or equal to
· $25,000and
5% of the portion of the Modified New Balance greater than $25,000
· and less than or equal to $75,000and
10% of the portion of the Modified New Balance greater than $75,000
II. T·hen divide the sum from step I by the Modified New Balance and round
to 4 decimals (ex. 0.1234).
3.Calculate the Portion of the Modified New Balance included in the Minimum
Payment Due by multiplying the Modified New Balance calculated in step 1
by the Applicable Rate calculated in step 2.
4.Add the part of the Interest Charged not included in the Amount Above the
Credit limit to the result from step 3.
Finally, we take the higher of(1) and(2) above and:
Add any Penalty Fees not included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit,
· Add any Amount Above the Credit Limit, after subtracting any part of the Past
· Due Amount thatis included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit (seeHow to
determine whether the Past Due Amount is included in the Amount Above the
Credit Limit below),
Then we round to the nearest dollar and add any Past Due Amount.

$729.01 + $0 Interest Charged not included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit =
$729.01
The higher of (1) or (2) is $729.01.
$729.01 + $0 Penalty Fees not included in Amount Above the Credit Limit = $729.01.
$729.01 + ($450 Amount Above the Credit Limit - $0 Past Due Amount included in the Amount
Above the Credit Limit) = $1,179.01
$1,179 + $300 Past Due Amount = $1,479
If your Account has an Amount Above the Credit Limit, we do additional calculations to
determine what part of interest, fees, and the Past Due Amount are included in the
Amount Above the Credit Limit. You can see how to do these additional calculations in
theAdditional Calculations sub-section below.
Additional Calculations
How to determine whether Interest Charged is included in the Amount Above the
Credit Limit
To determine whether any part of Interest Charged is included in the Amount Above the
Credit Limit, we subtract the Amount Above the Credit Limit from the Interest Charged on
the statement.
If the result is less than or equal to zero, then all of the Interest is already
· included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
If the result is greater than zero, the result is the part of Interest not included in
· the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
EXAMPLE
Your Interest Charged is $62.63 and the Amount Above the Credit Limit is $250.
$62.63 Interest Charged on statement - $250 Amount Above the Credit Limit = -$187.37
· Because -$187.37 is less than zero, all of the Interest Charged on the statement is
already included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
Interest Charged not included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit is $0.
How to determine whether Penalty Fees are included in the Amount Above the
Credit Limit
To determine whether any part of Penalty Fees are included in the Amount Above the
Credit Limit:
(1) We subtract the Interest Charged from the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
(2) Then, we subtract the result of this Step 1 from the Penalty Fees.
If the result is less than or equal to zero, then all of the Penalty Fees are already
· included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
If the result is greater than zero, that amount is the part of the Penalty Fees not
· included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit.

EXAMPLE
Your Amount Above the Credit Limit is $250, Interest Charged is $62.63, Penalty Fees are $38.
(1) $250 Amount Above the Credit Limit - $62.63 Interest Charged = $187.37
(2) $38 Penalty Fee - $187.37 = -$149.37.
· Because -$149.37 is less than zero, all of the Penalty Fees are already included in the
Amount Above the Credit Limit.
Penalty Fees not included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit are $0.
How to determine whether the Past Due Amount is included in the Amount Above
the Credit Limit
To determine whether any part of the Past Due Amount is included in the Amount Above
the Credit Limit:
(1) We subtract the Credit Limit shown on your previous statement from the Previous
Balance.
If the result is less than or equal to zero, then none of the Past Due Amount is
· already included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
If the result is greater than zero, proceed to Step 2.
(2) W· e subtract any payments/credits shown on the statement from the result of the
previous step.
If the result is less than or equal to zero, then none of the Past Due Amount is
· already included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
If the result is greater than zero, then the result is the part of the Past Due
· Amount that is already included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit.
EXAMPLE
(1)
Your Previous Balance is $6,000, Credit Limit is $5,000, Payments shown are $750. $6,000
Previous Balance - $5,000 Credit Limit = $1,000. $1,000 is greater than zero. Proceed to Step
2.
(2)
$1,000 - $750 Payments shown = $250. $250 is greater than zero.
The Past Due Amount that is included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit is $250.

How to Avoid Interest on Purchases up to the Credit Limit
If you pay the New Balance on every billing statement by the Payment Due Date, we will
not charge interest on purchases.

interest billing period in which you made that payment. But we will charge interest on purchases
that are not included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit from the beginning of that
billing period until the date of your payment. If you do not pay the New Balance on a
statement by the Payment Due Date and then you pay the New Balance on each of the
next two statements by their Payment Due Dates, we will not charge interest on
purchases that are not included in the Amount Above the Credit Limit on the following
statement. Also, we will not charge interest on purchases on a statement if the Previous
Balance on that statement is zero or a credit balance.
How to Avoid Interest on the Amount Above the Credit Limit
For any particular billing period, we will not charge interest on the Amount Above the
Credit Limit if you pay at least your Minimum Payment Due from the previous billing

you pay less than the New Balance, we will charge interest, as per the How to Avoid
Interest on Purchases up to the Credit Limit, on purchases not included in the Amount
Above the Credit Limit.
Interest Charged If You Do Not Pay Your Minimum Payment Due
If you do not pay your Minimum Payment Due by the Closing Date of the billing period in
which it is due, we will apply the Penalty APR to the entire balance, including the Amount
Above the Credit Limit, if any, and any balance transfer (see How we calculate interest
below). We also may apply the Penalty APR for other reasons (see Penalty APR and
when it applies on page 2 of Part 1). If you do not pay the Minimum Payment Due on a
statement by the Closing Date of the billing period in which it is due and then you pay the
Minimum Payment Due on a subsequent statement by the Closing Date of the billing
period in which it is due, we will not charge interest on the Amount Above the Credit Limit
for the billing period for which you paid the Minimum Payment Due by the Closing Date in
which it is due. However, the Penalty APR will continue to apply to other balances
(including any balance transfer) in accordance with Penalty APR and when it applies on
page 2 of Part 1).
Application of Penalty APR in Your First Billing Period
If we apply the Penalty APR during the first billing period after your account was opened,
we will apply the Penalty APR to any balance transfer beginning the first day of the
second billing period.
We are removing this section in its entirety and replacing it with the modified language:
We calculate interest for a billing period by first calculating interest on each balance.
Different categories of transactions--such as purchases and balance transfers--may have
different interest rates. Balances within each category may also have different interest
rates. We use theAverage Daily Balance method (including new transactions) to
calculate interest charges for each balance. The total interest charged for a billing period
is the sum of the interest charged on each balance.
Interest
The interest charged for a balance in a billing period, except for variations caused by
rounding, equals:
Average Daily Balance(ADB) multiplied by
· Daily Periodic Rate(DPR) multiplied by
· Number of days the DPR was in effect.
How we calculate
·
interest ADB
To get the ADB for a balance, we add up each Daily Balance Subject to Interest (see
below). Then we divide the result by the number of days the DPR for that balance was in
effect. If the daily balance is negative, we treat it as zero.
DPR
A DPR is 1/365th of an APR, rounded to one ten thousandth of a percentage point. Your
DPRs are shown in How Rates and Fees Work on page 2 of Part 1.
EXAMPLE: Calculating Interest
Assume that you have a single interest rate of 15.99%, your ADB is $2,250 and there are
30 days in the billing period.
The DPR is 15.99% divided by 365 days = 0.0438%
The Interest is $2,250 multiplied by 0.0438% multiplied by 30 days = $29.57

Daily Balance
For each day a DPR is in effect, we calculate the Daily Balance by:
taking thebeginning balance for the day,
· adding any new charges,
· subtracting any payments or credits;
· making any appropriate adjustments.
·
We add a new charge to a Daily Balance as of its transaction date.
Daily Balance Subject to Interest
To calculate theDaily Balance Subject to Interest, we reduce the Daily Balance by the
amount above your credit limit on each day, if you pay the Minimum Payment Due by the
Closing Date of the billing period in which the payment is due.
However, if you do not pay the Minimum Payment Due by the Closing Date of the billing
period in which it is due, we will not reduce the Daily Balance by the amount above your
Credit Limit on each day. For purposes of the Daily Balance Subject to Interest, "credit
limit" is the lowest credit limit on any day during the billing period.
Beginning balance
For the first day of a billing period, the beginning balance is the ending balance for the
prior billing period, including unpaid interest. For the rest of the billing period, the
beginning balance is the previous day's Daily Balanceplus an amount of interest equal to
the previous day's Daily Balance Subject to Interest multiplied by the DPR for that
balance. This method of calculating the beginning balance results in daily compounding
of interest.
When an interest rate changes, the new DPR may come into effect during--not just at the
beginning of--the billing period. When this happens, we will create a new balance and
apply the new DPR to it. To get the beginning balance on the first day for this new
balance, we multiply the previous day's Daily Balance Subject to Interest by the old DPR
and add the result to that day's daily balance compounding of interest.
Other methods
To calculate the ADB and interest charges, we may use other formulas or methods that
produce equivalent results. Also, we may choose not to charge interest on certain types
of charges.
