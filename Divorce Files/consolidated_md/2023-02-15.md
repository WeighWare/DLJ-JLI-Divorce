About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called
"trailing interest". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that
happens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest
on purchases by paying your balance in full and on time each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your
Cardmember Agreement for details.

Changes to Your Card Benefits
Effective February 2, 2023, Basic Card Members will receive a new benefit,TakeOff 15, which will allow them to
save 15% each time they use miles to book Award Travel on Delta flights through delta.com and the Fly Delta
app. See additional Terms below.
TEeligrmibsili tayn: dB Casoicnd Diteioltnas SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve American Express Card Members, as well as Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold,
Platinum and Reserve Business American Express Card Members (each, an "Eligible Card"), can get at least a fifteen percent (15%) discount
off the mileage portion of an Award Ticket (the "TakeOff 15" benefit). Additional Card Members are not eligible. Available only if entire itinerary
is on Delta and Delta Connection® carrier-operated and ticketed flights booked at delta.com or the FlyDelta app. Not available on flights
operated by other carriers. Not available for Pay with Miles, Miles + Cash, seat upgrades purchased after the initial flight booking, or other
Delta products or services. Discount only applies to the mileage portion of the Award Ticket fare and does not apply to applicable taxes and
fees which must be paid using the Eligible Card. Card Member must be logged-in to a SkyMiles account linked to an Eligible Card to receive
the TakeOff 15 benefit discount. Mileage discount will be greater than or equal to 15% of the overall miles portion for the Award Ticket. An
Award Ticket is a ticket issued by Delta pursuant to the SkyMiles Program Rules, by which SkyMiles members may redeem miles and pay
applicable government-imposed taxes and fees in exchange for air transportation. All Award Ticket rules apply, as set forth on delta.com and
in the specific terms incorporated into your Award Ticket. Award Travel is defined as travel using an Award Ticket. Award Travel seats are
limited and may not be available on all flights or in all markets. SkyMiles account balance must have sufficient miles for the entire Award
Ticket(s) being purchased. TakeOff 15 benefit is not combinable with certificates, Delta eCredits, Delta Gift Cards, vouchers, or with any other
discounts or promotional offers.
Award Ticket Taxes/Fees: Award Ticket taxes and fees include only U.S. excise and departure/arrival taxes, airport charges, segment fees,
the September 11th Security Fee, and international taxes and fees normally included in the Award Ticket.
Award Ticket Cancellations and Changes: In the event of a voluntary cancellation of the Award Ticket to which the TakeOff 15 benefit was
applied, redeemed miles will be redeposited into the Card Member's SkyMiles account, except for Basic Economy tickets. Current Award
Ticket redeposit fees apply. Basic Economy cancellations will result in cancellation charge assessed in miles, as outlined in fare rules.
Remaining miles after deduction of the cancellation charge will be redeposited to Card Member's SkyMiles account. There is no discount
applicable to the cancellation charge. If changing an Award Ticket after ticketing, discount is applied to the new Award Ticket (if eligible), and
the difference in miles will be deducted from the Card Member's SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is higher) or
redeposited into the Card Member's SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is lower). Basic Economy tickets are not
eligible for voluntary changes. SkyMiles Member must be an active Basic Delta SkyMiles, Gold, Platinum or Reserve American Express Card
Member or Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum or Reserve Business American Express Card Member at time that the Award Ticket is
changed to be eligible for the TakeOff 15 benefit on the changed Award Ticket.
Miscellaneous: All SkyMiles Program rules apply to SkyMiles Program membership, miles, offers, mile accrual, mile redemption, and travel
benefits. To review the rules, please visit Program Rules. SkyMiles Program and offers are void where prohibited by law, and terms are
subject to change without notice. Other restrictions apply.
