This table presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months.
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed.
These estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed income are calculated using the security's coupon
rate. The estimates for all other securities are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next
12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no assurance can
be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.
Bond & CD Income includes interest payments for fixed and variable rate bonds, international bonds that pay in USD, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
Bond & CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for fixed and variable rate bonds, international bonds that pay in USD, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
Stock Income includes estimated dividend payments for common stocks, preferred stocks, ADRs, closed-end mutual funds, and MLPs.
ETP Income includes estimated dividend payments for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs).
Mutual Fund Income includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds.
Other Income includes, but is not limited to estimated dividend payments for Unit Investment Trusts (UITs), REITs, and LPs.
This table does not include cash flow from foreign denominated fixed income.

Cost Basis - the original amount paid for a security, including the amount of reinvested dividends and capital gains, plus or minus certain adjustments. See last page of statement for details.
Total Cost Basis does not include the cost basis on core, money market or other positions where cost basis is unknown or not applicable.
EAI Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY ) - EAI is an estimate of annual income for a specific security position over the next rolling 12 months. EAI may be negative on short
& EY positions. EY is calculated by dividing the current EAI for a security position by its statement closing date market value. EAI and EY are estimates only and may include return of principal
and/or capital gains, which would render them overstated. Actual income and yield might be lower or higher than the estimated amounts. F o r calculation details, refer to the
"Additional Information and Endnotes" section.
-- not available
p (pending settlement) - quantity and value and/or units and shares may change upon receipt of settlement confirmation from fund sponsor.
A Investments such as direct participation program securities (e.g., partnerships, limited liability companies, and real estate investment trusts which are not listed on any exchange), commodity
pools, private equity, private debt and hedge funds are generally illiquid investments and their current values may be different from the purchase price. Unless otherwise indicated, the values
shown in this statement for such investments have been provided by the management, administrator or sponsor of each program or a third-party vendor without independent verification by
FBS and represent their estimate of the value of the investor's participation in the program, as of a date no greater than 12 months from the date of this statement. Therefore, the price
received upon liquidation may be less than the per share estimated value provided in the statement. If an estimated value is not provided, accurate valuation information is not available.
Unless noted as "pending settlement", Alternative Investments reflecting a quantity of 1.000 shares may currently be reporting a negative balance. Please contact the issuer or sponsor for
more information.

Additional Information and Endnotes
Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY) - EAI for fixed income is calculated using the coupon rate. For all other securities, EAI is calculated using an
indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for
that security. EY reflects only the income generated by an investment and not changes in its price which may fluctuate. Interest and dividend rates are subject to change at
any time and may be affected by current and future economic, political and business conditions. EAI and EY are provided for informational purposes only and should not
be used or relied on for making investment, trading or tax decisions. EAI and EY are based on data obtained from information providers believed to be reliable, but no
assurance can be made as to accuracy, timeliness or completeness.
