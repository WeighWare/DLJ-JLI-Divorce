TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. Scope of Work. Dominion Energy Utah ("Company") shall construct and install a natural gas service line and appurtenant facilities as set forth above (collectively the "Facilities"). Installation of the
Facilities, as specified above and as designated in the field, as well as any related work, is referred to as the "Work". This Agreement shall not be deemed to be in force until Customer has signed this
Agreement and returned it to Company. Company does not accept and expressly rejects any changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, handwritten or otherwise.

weather-related costs, tax consequences related to the contribution in aid of the construction, and any costs arising from Customer requests or Customer caused delays (collectively "Construction Costs"),
provided Company personnel costs and overhead shall be borne solely by Company. THE COSTS SHOWN ABOVE ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM EXECUTION OF THIS
AGREEMENT. After such thirty (30) days, any or all costs may change by the time the Work is performed. Customer is responsible to pay any increased costs upon receipt of Company's invoice.
b. Customer agrees to pay, prior to the date of installation, the Amount Now Due shown above. Subject to subparagraph (a). Customer shall also pay any additional Construction Costs that may arise during
installation, including but not limited to increased labor costs, increased costs of materials, frost and/or rock trenching ("Additional Construction Costs") within thirty (30) days of the Company invoice date.
Any change to the length or scope of the Facilities, whether due to Customer request or Company\'s determination, in its sole discretion, that the initial design must be modified, that result in increased
Construction Costs shall also be included as Additional Construction Costs.
c. Interest accrues at the rate of six percent (6.0%) per annum on any amount due from such installation or invoice date until the amount due is paid in full. Customer will pay all costs and attorney\'s fees
incurred in the collection of any amount.

incurred up to the date of cancellation.
5. Subcontractors. Company may subcontract with third parties for the provision of any of the services contemplated by this Agreement.
6. Contamination. If Company encounters any contaminated soil or groundwater during the trenching and installation of facilities that requires remediation or disposal, or poses a hazard, Company may
suspend the installation or trenching until the contamination is removed, disposed of and/or remediated to Company's satisfaction and at no cost to Company. If Company elects to remediate the
contamination, Customer shall pay all costs incurred by Company arising from or caused by the remediation as Additional Construction Costs
7. Force Majeure. Company shall have the right to allocate materials and labor to construction projects which it deems, in its sole discretion, most important to serve the needs or ensure the safety of its
customers due to emergencies or in the event Company is unable to obtain sufficient supplies, materials, or labor for all of its construction requirements, and Company shall not be responsible to
Customer or any third party for construction delays resulting from such allocation. Company shall not be responsible for any delay to the extent arising from or caused by (a) the performance of
Customer's responsibilities under this Agreement or (b) shortage of labor or materials, strike, labor disturbance, war, riot, weather conditions (including, but not limited to, conditions that, in Company's
sole judgment, prevent it from safely excavating or backfilling trenches or installing facilities using its normal construction methods and equipment), government rule, regulation or order, including
